# Boxswap Decentralized Exchange Project
<br />
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>This is a simple decentralized exchange project created using React.js for the frontend along with Ethers.js, window.ethereum API, and solidity for the blockchain backend.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Utilization: </h2>
<p>Deploy "Token.sol" on the Remix IDE in order to make your own tokens (Be wary of the decimals on  the token contract). Afterwards, you can go on the demo and "Add Liquidity" and begin swapping your sample tokens.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Demo: </h2>
<b/>The link to the hosted project is here :: <a href="https://boxswap.vercel.app/">Boxswap</a>. <b>Note you must have Metamask installed along with testnet Matic on the Mumbai Testnet.</b>
<br/>
<b>NOTE:: The hosted version is running on the Mumbai Testnet. In order to add custom tokens into the pools, go make a copy of the "Token.sol" contract and deploy a few token contracts (On the Mumbai Testnet) & mint your own tokens on those respective tokens. Afterwards, create new token DEX pairs on the hosted boxswap app online.</b>
