# Boxswap Decentralized Exchange Project
This is a simple decentralized exchange project created using React.js for the frontend along with Ethers.js, window.ethereum API, and solidity for the blockchain backend. 
The link to the hosted project is here :: <a href="https://boxswap.vercel.app/">Boxswap</a>

<b>NOTE::: The hosted version is running on the Mumbai Testnet. In order to add custom tokens into the pools, go make a copy of the "Token.sol" contract and deploy a few token contracts (On the Mumbai Testnet) & mint your own tokens on those respective tokens. Afterwards, create new token DEX pairs on the hosted boxswap app online.</b>
